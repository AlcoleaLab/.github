# 💫 About Us:
🔭Alcolea Lab<br>Welcome to the GitHub organisation of Alcolea Lab at the Cambridge Stem Cell Institute, University of Cambridge.<br>Led by Dr. Maria Alcolea, our lab focuses on understanding epithelial cell fate and plasticity. We investigate the behaviour of epithelial stem cells in response to injury and tumour development.<br><br>🔬Research Focus<br><br>Epithelial stem cell dynamics<br>Cellular plasticity in injury response and cancer development<br>Progenitor cell behaviour in the mouse oesophagus<br><br>🤝 Team Members[🔗](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/directory/maria-alcolea-group)<br><br>🌱 Publications[🔗](https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/people/pi/alcolea)<br><br>💬 Contact Information<br>Dr. Maria Alcolea<br>Email: mpa28@cam.ac.uk<br>Cambridge Stem Cell Institute<br>Jeffrey Cheah Biomedical Centre<br>University of Cambridge
